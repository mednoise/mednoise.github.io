=================================

If you think you’ve encountered a bug in **mednoise**, please report it on the `Github issue tracker <https://github.com/mednoise/mednoise/issues>`_ . To be useful, bug reports must include the following information:

- A reproducible code example that demonstrates the problem
- The output that you are seeing (ex. the error message)
- A clear explanation of why you think something is wrong
- The specific versions of **mednoise** and **NumPy** that you are working with

It is preferable that you provide synthetic medical images to reproduce the problem. If you can only demonstrate the issue with your actual dataset, you will need to share it, ideally as a zip file.

If you’ve encountered an error, searching the specific text of the message before opening a new issue can often help you solve the problem quickly and avoid making a duplicate report.

General support questions are more at home on either stackoverflow or discourse, which have a larger audience of people who will see your post and may be able to offer assistance. StackOverflow is better for specific issues, while discourse is better for more open-ended discussion. Your chance of getting a quick answer will be higher if you include runnable code, a precise statement of what you are hoping to achieve, and a clear explanation of the problems that you have encountered.
